                <p>There are <b>80 known moons</b> of Jupiter, not counting a number of moonlets likely shed from the inner moons. All together, they form a satellite system which 
                   is called the <b>Jovian system</b>. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons: <b>Io</b>, <b>Europa</b>, <b>Ganymede</b>, and <b>Callisto</b>, which were independently discovered 
                   in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. Much more recently, beginning in 
                   1892, dozens of far smaller Jovian moons have been detected and have received the names of lovers (or other sexual partners) or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter 
                   or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit Jupiter, with the remaining 76 known moons and the rings 
                   together composing just <b>0.003%</b> of the total orbiting mass.</p>
    
                <p>Of Jupiter's moons, eight are regular satellites with prograde and nearly circular orbits that are not greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter's 
                   equatorial plane. The Galilean satellites are nearly <b>spherical</b> in shape due to their planetary mass, and so would be considered at least <b>dwarf planets</b> 
                   if they were in direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular satellites are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust 
                   that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are <b>irregular satellites</b> whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter 
                   and have high inclinations and eccentricities. These moons were probably captured by Jupiter from solar orbits. <b>Twenty-three</b> of the irregular satellites have 
                   not yet been officially named.</p>
                   
                <p>The physical and orbital characteristics of the moons vary widely. The four Galileans are all over <b>3,100 kilometres</b> (1,900 mi) in diameter; the largest 
                   Galilean, Ganymede, is the <b>ninth largest object</b> in the Solar System, after the Sun and seven of the planets, Ganymede being <b>larger</b> than Mercury. All other 
                   Jovian moons are less than 250 kilometres (160 mi) in diameter, with most barely exceeding 5 kilometres (3.1 mi). Their orbital shapes range from nearly 
                   perfectly circular to highly eccentric and inclined, and many revolve in the direction opposite to Jupiter's rotation (retrograde motion). Orbital periods 
                   range from seven hours (taking less time than Jupiter does to rotate around its axis), to some three thousand times more (almost three Earth years).</p>
