            <p>The <b>Great Red Spot</b> is a persistent <b>high-pressure region</b> in the <b>atmosphere of Jupiter</b>, producing an <b>anticyclonic storm</b> that is the largest 
               in the Solar System. Located 22 degrees south of Jupiter's equator, it produces wind-speeds up to <b>432 km/h</b> (268 mph). Observations from 1665 to 1713 are 
               believed to be of the same storm; if this is correct, it has existed for at least <b>357 years</b>. It was next observed in September 1831, with 60 recorded 
               observations between then and 1878, when continuous observations began.</p>

            <p><h3><b><u>History of the Great Red spot:</u></b></h3>The Great Red Spot may have existed since before 1665, but it could also be the case that the present 
                         spot was first seen only in 1830, and well-studied only after a prominent apparition in 1879. The storm that was seen in the 17th century may 
                         have been different than the storm that exists today. A <b>long gap</b> separates its period of current study after 1830 from its 17th century 
                         discovery. Whether the original spot dissipated and reformed, whether it faded, or if the observational record was simply poor is unknown.
                         For example, the first sighting of the Great Red Spot is often credited to <b>Robert Hooke</b>, who described a spot on the planet in <b>May 1664</b>. However, 
                         it is likely that Hooke's spot was not only in another belt altogether (the North Equatorial Belt, as opposed to the current Great Red Spot's 
                         location in the South Equatorial Belt), but also that it was the shadow of a transiting moon, most likely that of Callisto.</p>
            
            <p>The Great Red Spot has been observed since 5 September 1831. By 1879 over <b>60 observations</b> were recorded. After it came into prominence in 1879, it 
               has been under continuous observation. In the 21st century, the Great Red Spot was seen to be shrinking in size. At the start of 2004, it had approximately 
               half the longitudinal extent it had had a century ago, when it reached a size of <b>40,000 km</b> (25,000 mi), about <b>three times the diameter of Earth</b>. At the 
               present rate of reduction, it would become circular by 2040. It is not known how long the spot will last, or whether the change is a result of normal 
               fluctuations. In 2019, the Great Red Spot began <b>"flaking"</b> at its edge, with fragments of the storm breaking off and dissipating. The shrinking and 
               "flaking" fueled concern from some astronomers that the Great Red Spot could dissipate within 20 years.[citation needed] However, other astronomers 
               believe that the apparent size of the Great Red Spot reflects its cloud coverage and not the size of the actual, underlying vortex, and they also believe 
               that the flaking events can be explained by interactions with other cyclones or anticyclones, including incomplete absorptions of smaller systems; if 
               this is the case, this would mean that the Great Red Spot is not in danger of dissipating.</p>
