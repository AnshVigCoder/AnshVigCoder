    <ul>
        <li>Jupiter is the <b>fifth planet</b> from the Sun.</li>
        <li>Jupiter is the <b>largest planet</b> in the solar system and with a <b>mass of almost three times</b> that of all the planets in the solar system combined.</li>
        <li>Jupiter is the <b>third brightest natural object</b> in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus.</li>
        <li>Jupiter has the <b>deepest planetary atmosphere</b> in the Solar System, spanning over 5,000 km (3,000 mi) in altitude.</li>
        <li><b>Galileo</b> was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter</li>
        <li>Jupiter is a gas giant with <b>4 rings</b> known as the halo ring, the main ring, the Amalthea gossamer ring, and the Thebe gossamer ring.</li>
        <li>Jupiter has <b>53 named moons</b> and other <b>26 moons</b> havent got official names.</li>
    </ul>
    <font color = "Taupe"><h2><u>Let us study even more deeply in Jupiter:</u></h2></font>
    <p><b><u>Composition:</u></b>Jupiter's upper atmosphere is about <b>90% hydrogen</b> and <b>10% helium</b> by volume.
                                 Since helium atoms are more massive than hydrogen molecules, Jupiter's atmosphere is approximately 75% hydrogen and 24% helium
                                 by mass, with the remaining one percent consisting of other elements. The atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane, 
                                 water vapour, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds. There are also fractional amounts of carbon, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, neon, 
                                 oxygen, phosphine, and sulfur. The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains crystals of frozen ammonia. Through infrared and 
                                 ultraviolet measurements, trace amounts of benzene and other hydrocarbons have also been found. The interior of Jupiter 
                                 contains denser materials—by mass it is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% other elements.</p>

    <p><b><u>Mass and Size:</u></b>Jupiter's mass is <b>2.5 times</b> that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined—this is so massive that its barycentre
                                   with the Sun lies above the Sun's surface at 1.068 solar radii from the Sun's centre.Jupiter is much larger than Earth and 
                                   considerably less dense: its volume is that of about <b>1,321 Earths</b>, but it is only 318 times as massive. Jupiter's radius is about
                                   one tenth the radius of the Sun, and its mass is one thousandth the mass of the Sun, so the densities of the two bodies are 
                                   similar. A "Jupiter mass" (<b>MJ</b> or <b>MJup</b>) is often used as a unit to describe masses of other objects, particularly extrasolar planets 
                                   and brown dwarfs. For example, the extrasolar planet HD 209458 b has a mass of 0.69 MJ, while Kappa Andromedae b has a mass of 12.8 MJ.</p>
    <p><b><u>Internal Structure:</u></b>Before the early 21st century, most scientists expected Jupiter to either consist of a dense core, a surrounding layer
                                        of liquid metallic hydrogen (with some helium) extending outward to about 80% of the radius of the planet, and an outer
                                        atmosphere consisting predominantly of molecular hydrogen, or perhaps to have no core at all, consisting instead of 
                                        denser and denser fluid (predominantly molecular and metallic hydrogen) all the way to the center, depending on whether 
                                        the planet accreted first as a solid body or collapsed directly from the gaseous protoplanetary disk. When the Juno 
                                        mission arrived in July 2016, it found that Jupiter has a very diffuse core that mixes into its mantle. A possible 
                                        cause is an impact from a planet of about ten Earth masses a few million years after Jupiter's formation, which would have 
                                        disrupted an originally solid Jovian core. It is estimated that the core is <b>30–50%</b> of the planet's radius, and contains 
                                        heavy elements <b>7–25 times</b> the mass of Earth.</p>

                                     <p>Above the layer of metallic hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and 
                                         temperature are above molecular hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.3 MPa and critical temperature of only 33 K (−240.2 °C; 
                                         −400.3 °F). In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen is said to be in a supercritical 
                                         fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas extending downward from the cloud layer to a depth of about <b>1,000 km</b>
                                         (620 mi), and as liquid in deeper layers, possibly resembling something akin to an ocean of liquid hydrogen and 
                                         other supercritical fluids.</p>
